                        <b>Encryption of your data in transit.</b> Encryption provides a high level of security and
                        privacy for your data. When you
                        enter your data in our platform we use strong encryption technologies (such as Transport
                        Layer Security) to protect your
                        data during transmission from your devices to our servers.
                        For providing more trust and security we use digital EV (Extended Validation) Certificates
                        issued by trusted Certificate
                        Authorities. You can see the ‘Green Bar’ in the supported browser versions which confirms
                        what all transmitted data is
                        secure.

                        <b>Protection of your data in our infrastructure.</b> We make it a priority to develop
                        services that are secure "by default".
                        The "default" security of our services means that all new services and features are designed
                        with strict security
                        requirements in mind before we even begin development. This is the key to guaranteed
                        protection and privacy of all data
                        that our services handle and store, once the service or new feature is released.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        To secure your data, we use the pseudonymisation which allows most of our services to operate
                        without using your actual
                        data. Instead of that, our services use a system ID that can't be traced back to identify
                        you.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The Company is always vigilant about the security of your data stored in our infrastructure.
                        Because of that we locate
                        all our equipment which is used for your data processing in secure data centers. Network
                        access to this equipment is
                        isolated from the Internet. We use network segmentation for isolation of services which need
                        different levels of
                        security from each other. In addition, we restrict logical access to your data for our
                        employees on a "need to know"
                        basis. So, only the personnel that really require access to your data for the purpose of
                        providing you with our best
                        service, will have access to it.

                        <b>Threats protection.</b> Our Company is highly knowledgeable about modern threats to data
                        security and privacy, and we are
                        well prepared to combat them. All events that occur in our infrastructure are continuously
                        monitored, analyzed and
                        responded to, which allows us to ensure proper protection of your data, keeping it safe from
                        threats, vulnerabilities,
                        and the effects of malware.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        In the event of a failure that affects the accessibility of your data, we have data backup
                        and recovery procedures in
                        place that will help us restore your data in a short time. To guarantee quick recovery, we
                        use high availability mode
                        enabled for most critical databases which allows us to minimize downtime.

                        employees’ actions with access to
                        your data in our systems and grant access strictly on a "need to know" basis: only employees
                        who need access will
                        receive it. We hold regular training sessions to make sure that each employee understands the

                        Company follows to achieve robust data security and privacy.
