                     <p>Syphex, a global brand, which is operated by Sun Wave LLC, a company registered at
                        Lighthouse Trust Nevis Ltd, Suite 1, A.L. Evelyn Ltd Building, Main Street, Charlestown, Nevis
                        (hereinafter the <b>Company</b>) is required to establish and provide its Clients (as defined in
                        the
                        Agreement) and potential clients an order execution policy in the form of the present
                        (hereinafter
                        called the “Policy”) and take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result (or “best
                        execution”) on behalf of Clients.
                     </p>
                     <p>This Policy forms part of the Company’s Terms & Conditions (the <b>Agreement</b> or <b>Terms and
                           Conditions</b>).</p>
                     <p>By opening a trading account, you acknowledge that the Financial Instruments (as defined
                        below) offered by the Company are traded over the counter (OTC) and therefore consent to the
                        fact that your orders will be executed outside a regulated exchange or multilateral trading
                        facility</p>

                     <p>Where this Policy refers to Financial Instruments, it shall be taken to mean all the Company’s
                        products (as these are listed below) collectively.
                     </p>
                     <h3><b>Scope of Application</b></h3>
                     <p>The Company is executing Clients’ orders in relation to the following Financial Instruments:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Option Contracts (i.e. Digital Options and/or Binary Options and/or Blitz Options) in
                           stocks, commodities, indices and currency pairs and/or ,
                        </li>
                        <li>Contracts for Differences (CFDs) on stocks, commodities, ETFs, currency pairs and
                           cryptocurrencies.
                        </li>
                     </ul>

                     <p>It is up to the Company’s sole discretion to decide which types of Financial Instruments to make
                        available.</p>
                     <p>It is understood that trades are placed with the Company via the online trading platform only
                        and
                        that the Company does not facilitate telephone orders or face-to-face trading, i.e. all trading
                        activity is 100% automated. The Company is the counterparty to clients’ trades and transacts
                        with clients as principal. The Company automatically records all orders and allocates them in
                        sequential order, ensuring their fair and prompt execution.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Company publishes, through its Trading Platform, the live-streaming prices at which the
                        Financial Instruments offered can be traded.</p>
                     <p>The Company acts as the sole Execution Venue (as defined further below) and as principal to
                        the Clients’ trades. Clients’ positions are not transferable, and Clients can only close their
                        positions with the Company.</p>
                     <p>All information relating to executed trades is immediately available on your platform, and your
                        profit and loss for an associated closed trade is reflected in the balance of your trading
                        account.
                     </p>
                     <p>This Policy ensures compliance with the Company’s obligation to execute orders on terms most
                        favorable to Clients.</p>

                     <h3>Best Execution Factors & Criteria</h3>
                     <p>When executing Clients’ orders, the Company takes into account the following “Execution
                        Factors”, in order to obtain the best possible result for its Clients:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Price</li>
                        <li>Costs</li>
                        <li>Speed and likelihood of execution and settlement</li>
                        <li>Size and nature</li>
                        <li>Market conditions and variations</li>
                        <li>Any other consideration relevant to the execution of the order.</li>
                     </ul>

                     <p>Price and costs will ordinarily be of high relative importance in obtaining the best possible
                        results.
                     </p>
                     <p>However, in some circumstances, reference to the “Execution Criteria” may appropriately
                        determine that Execution Factors have greater importance in achieving the best possible result
                        for the Client. The Company shall determine the relative importance of the Execution Factors by
                        taking into account the characteristics of the following Execution Criteria:</p>

                     <ul>
                        <li>The Client, including the categorization of the Client as retail or professional</li>
                        <li>The Client’s order</li>
                        <li>The Financial Instruments that are the subject of that order, and</li>
                        <li>Any other Execution Venues to which that order may be directed.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>For retail clients, the best possible result shall be determined in terms of the total
                        consideration,
                        representing the price of the Financial Instrument and the costs related to execution, which
                        shall
                        include all expenses incurred by the Client which are directly related to the execution of the
                        order and any other fees paid to third parties involved in the execution of the order and any
                        other fees paid to third parties involved in the execution of the order (if applicable).
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the Company’s policy to maintain such internal procedures and principles in order to
                        determine and to act for the best interest of its Clients and provide them with the best
                        possible
                        result (or “best execution”) when dealing with them.</p>

                     <h3><b>Clients Trading in Option Contracts</b></h3>
                     <p><b>Price:</b> The Company will quote one price at which the Client can open an order. Prices for
                        any
                        given option are calculated by reference to the BID and ASK prices of the relevant underlying
                        financial instrument and can be found on the Company’s trading platform.</p>
                     <p>Prices are updated frequently as the limitations of technology and communication links allow.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Company ensures that the Client will receive the best price by guaranteeing that the
                        calculation of the quoted prices is made with reference and compared to a range of underlying
                        price providers and data sources.
                     </p>
                     <p>Please note that despite taking reasonable steps to obtain the best possible results for
                        Clients,
                        the Company is unable to guarantee, when executing orders, that the prices offered will be more
                        favorable than prices that might be available elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>Under certain trading conditions, the Client should note that it may be impossible to execute an
                        Order at their requested price. In such cases, the Company reserves the right to execute the
                        Order at the first available price. Such instances may occur during times of high market
                        volatility
                        and price fluctuations, e.g. when the price of an asset rises or falls in one trading session to
                        such an extent that, under the rules of the relevant exchange, trading is suspended or
                        restricted.
                        The available prices provided by the Company are calculated as (ASK+BID)/2, i.e. the average
                        between the BID and ASK prices.
                     </p>
                     <p><b>Costs:</b> No commissions or financing fees are charged by the Company for Digital Option
                        Contracts trading.</p>
                     <p>The Company reserves the right to, at any time, apply such charges in the future with prior
                        notice to the Client. Such notice may be sent personally to the Client and/or posted on the
                        Company’s website. Should the Company at any period of time decide not to charge any costs,
                        it shall not be construed as a waiver of its rights to apply them in the future.</p>
                     <p><b>Speed of Execution:</b> The Company executes the Client orders as a principal to principal
                        against the Client, i.e. the Company is the execution venue for the execution of the Client’s
                        Order. The Company strives to offer a high speed of execution, however, in certain
                        circumstances, for example low internet speed or market volatility, the quoted price may no
                        longer be representative of the underlying market price and may result in the Client placing
                        his/her Order at a delay, this may result in orders being executed at a better or worse
                        prevailing
                        price offered by the Company.
                     </p>
                     <p><b>Likelihood of Execution:</b> The Company acts as principal and not as an agent on the
                        Client’s
                        behalf. The Company relies on its price fed providers for pricing, hence the execution of the
                        Client orders shall depend on the availability of services of the price feed providers. Although
                        the Company executes all Client orders, in some instances, it may not be possible to arrange an
                        Order for execution during abnormal market conditions. This can occur, but is not limited to,
                        the
                        following examples: overnight, during news times, the opening of trading sessions, volatile
                        markets (where prices may move significantly up or down and away from declared prices),
                        where there is rapid price movement, where there is insufficient liquidity for the execution of
                        the
                        specific volume at the declared price or a force majeure event has occurred.</p>
                     <p>For clarification purposes, abnormal market conditions as indicated above, might include
                        situations where the underlying asset might be subject to split and/or reverse split; in such
                        instances the Company, may decide (upon its absolute discretion) to close the client’s
                        position(s) held in the referred asset with the last available price on the platform prior to
                        the
                        occurrence of the split and/or reverse split event and the client will receive a notification in
                        this
                        regard.
                     </p>
                     <p>In the event where the Company is unable to proceed with an Order in relation to price or size
                        or for any reason, the Order will be executed at the first available price or not executed at
                        all. In
                        addition, please note, that the Company is entitled, at any time and at its discretion, without
                        giving any notice or explanation to the Client, to decline or refuse to execute any Order or
                        request of the Client in circumstances explained in the Terms & Conditions.</p>

                     <h3><b>Clients Trading in CFDs</b></h3>
                     <p><b>Price:</b> The price for a given contract is calculated by reference to the price of the
                        relevant
                        underlying financial instrument. For any given CFD, the Company will quote two prices: the
                        higher price (ASK) at which the Client can buy (go long) that CFD, and the lower price (BID) at
                        which the Client can sell (go short) that CFD. Collectively, the ASK and BID prices are referred
                        to as the Company’s prices and can be found on the Company’s trading platform.</p>
                     <p>The difference between the lower and the higher price of a given CFD is the spread</p>
                     <p>Prices are updated frequently as the limitations of technology and communication links allow.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Company ensures that the Client will receive the best price by guaranteeing that the
                        calculation of the quoted prices is made with reference and compared to a range of underlying
                        price providers and data sources.</p>
                     <p>Please note that despite taking reasonable steps to obtain the best possible results for
                        Clients,
                        the Company is unable to guarantee, when executing orders, that the prices offered will be more
                        favorable than prices that might be available elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>Under certain trading conditions, the Client should note that it may be impossible to execute an
                        Order at their requested price. In such cases, the Company reserves the right to execute the
                        Order at the first available price. Such instances may occur during times of high market
                        volatility
                        and price fluctuations, e.g. when the price of an asset rises or falls in one trading session to
                        such an extent that, under the rules of the relevant exchange, trading is suspended or
                        restricted.</p>
                     <p><b>Costs:</b> In most circumstances, a spread is applied. The spread is dynamic for certain
                        Financial
                        Instruments, and may take into account factors such as liquidity in external markets for the
                        underlying financial instrument and competitive pricing. The Company reserves the right to
                        charge the Client a swap fee (of up to 0.5% of the face value of the position) for keeping a
                        position open overnight. This swap fee can be subject to changes in the future.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Company reserves the right to charge a commission for opening a short Cryptocurrency
                        CFD trading position, which shall be equal or up to 15% of the transaction. For leveraged CFD
                        cryptocurrency positions, the Company will charge a commission fee of up to 5% of the
                        transaction.</p>
                     <p>In certain circumstances (such as increased volatility or illiquidity in relation to the
                        underlying
                        market concerned) the Company reserves the right to alter the spreads offered.</p>
                     <p>In other circumstances, Clients may be charged overnight funding premiums.</p>
                     <p>The Company reserves the right to, at any time, apply such charges in the future with prior
                        notice to the Client. Such notice may be sent personally to the Client and/or posted on the
                        Company’s website. Should the Company at any period of time decide not to charge any costs,
                        it shall not be construed as a waiver of its rights to apply them in the future.
                     </p>
                     <p><b>Speed of Execution:</b> The Company executes the Client orders in CFDs as a principal to
                        principal against the Client, i.e. the Company is the execution venue for the execution of the
                        Client’s Order. The Company strives to offer a high speed of execution, however, in certain
                        circumstances, for example low internet speed or market volatility, the quoted price may no
                        longer be representative of the underlying market price and may result in the Client placing
                        his/her Order at a delay, this may result in orders being executed at a better or worse
                        prevailing
                        price offered by the Company.
                     </p>
                     <p><b>Likelihood of Execution:</b> The likelihood of execution depends on the availability of the
                        prices of
                        the price feed providers of the Company. In some instances, it may not be possible to arrange
                        an Order for execution during abnormal market conditions. This can occur, but is not limited to,
                        the following examples: overnight, during news times, the opening of trading sessions, volatile
                        markets (where prices may move significantly up or down and away from declared prices),
                        where there is rapid price movement, where there is insufficient liquidity for the execution of
                        the
                        specific volume at the declared price or a force majeure event has occurred.
                     </p>
                     <p>For clarification purposes, abnormal market conditions as indicated above, might include
                        situations where the underlying asset might be subject to split and/or reverse split; in such
                        instances the Company, may decide (upon its absolute discretion) to close the client’s
                        position(s) held in the referred asset with the last available price on the platform prior to
                        the
                        occurrence of the split and/or reverse split event and the client will receive a notification in
                        this
                        regard.
                     </p>
                     <p>In the event that the Company is unable to proceed with an Order in relation to price or size or
                        for any reason, the Order will be executed at the first available price or not executed at all.
                        In
                        addition, please note, that the Company is entitled, at any time and at its discretion, without

                     <h3><b>Execution Practices in CFDs on Margin</b></h3>
                     <p><b>Slippage:</b> You are warned that Slippage may occur when trading in CFDs on Margin. Slippage
                        is the difference between the expected price of an Order, and the price the Order is actually
                        executed at. In some situations, at the time an Order is presented for execution, the specific
                        price shown to the Client may not be available; therefore, the Order will be executed close to
                        or
                        a number of pips away from the Client’s requested price</p>
                     <p>Slippage can occur at times of low liquidity or high volatility (e.g. after economic events or
                        news
                        announcements) and is a normal element of trading in CFDs</p>
                     <p><b>Initial margin:</b> any payment for the purpose of entering into a CFD, excluding commission,
                        transaction fees and any other related costs; initial margin is to be calculated based on the
                        exposure provided by the ultimate underlying of a CFD.
                     </p>
                     <p><b>Leverage (Multiplier):</b> The use of the multiplier tool in CFD trading enables the client
                        to trade in
                        the markets and increase proportionally the returns of his/her invested amount, in relation to
                        the
                        returns in the market.</p>
                     <p><b>Warning:</b> Trading CFDs on Margin carries a high level of risk since the multiplier tool
                        (leverage)
                        can work both to your advantage and disadvantage.
                     </p>
                     <p><b>Maintenance Margin:</b> The maintenance margin is the minimum amount of equity required to
                        maintain open positions. The Clients have to maintain a certain level of their own funds in
                        their
                        account balance in order to maintain open positions.</p>
                     <p>The Maintenance Margin is the minimum amount of equity in a position required to maintain an
                        open CFD position. Should this amount fall below 95%, the Company will automatically reserve
                        an additional amount from the Client’s trading account balance equivalent to 20% of the initial
                        investment amount in order for the CFD position to remain open. If the CFD position takes
                        further losses, the Client’s available balance is further reduced by 20% accordingly. The Client
                        can limit the additional funds reserved on his account balance by specifying his acceptable
                        level
                        of loss for a CFD position</p>

                     <p>For the purposes of the provisions relating to best execution, “Execution Venue” shall mean a
                        regulated market, multilateral trading facilities (MTF), systematic internalizers (SI), market
                        makers, liquidity providers or any other entity that facilitates trading of Financial
                        Instruments. For
                        the purpose of this policy, it is understood that the Company is the sole Execution Venue</p>
                     <p>Although the Company may at its own discretion transmit your orders for execution to third-party
                        liquidity providers, contractually the Company is the counterparty to your trades and any
                        execution of orders is done in the Company’s name; therefore, the Company is the sole
                        Execution Venue for the execution of the clients’ orders and acts as a principal and not as an
                        agent on the Clients’ behalf.
                     </p>
                     <p>The client acknowledges that the transactions entered in Financial Instruments with the
                        Company are not undertaken on a recognized exchange.
                     </p>
                     <h3><b>Specific Client Instructions</b></h3>
                     <p>Where the client provides the Company with specific instructions as to the execution of an
                        Order, the Company shall execute the Order in accordance with that specific instruction, and
                        will
                        proceed in taking all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result. It should be noted
                        that
                        specific instructions may prevent the Company from following this Policy.</p>
                     <p>Where the client’s instruction relates to only part of the Order, the Company will continue to
                        apply its Order Execution Policy to those aspects of the Order not covered by the specific
                        instruction.
                     </p>
                     <h3><b>Trading Hours</b></h3>

                        quality of the procedures explained in this Policy, making any changes where appropriate.</p>
                     <p>As part of the monitoring process, the Company will consider the following:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Reconciliation of trades: As the Company executes the Client’s trades, it is the
                           responsibility of the Company to ensure that these orders are executed in line with this
                           Policy. The Company monitors all best execution factors via numerous internal controls
                           and processes</li>
                        <li>Price: The Company has established sound arrangements, controls and procedures in
                           relation to price feed monitoring by cross-checking the prices offered to its Clients with
                           the prices offered by the feed providers and reliant market data sources. Any price
                           deviations are further investigated.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>In addition, the Company will review this Policy at least once a year and will notify its
                        clients of
                        any material changes (including changes to the selected Execution Venues and third-party
                        brokers, if applicable). Upon request, the Company will demonstrate to its Clients that it has
                        executed their orders in accordance with its Order Execution Policy.
                     </p>
                     <h3><b>Client Consent</b></h3>
                     <p>When establishing a business relation with the Client, the Company is required to obtain the
