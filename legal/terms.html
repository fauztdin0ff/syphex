                           and available for the client as long as the price remains unchanged. Three seconds from the
                           moment of giving the order to the Company by the Client via the platform, the Company may
                           (but is not obliged to) offer to buyout the option from the Client and the Client has the
                           right to agree to such offer (hereinafter referred to as the “Buyout”). The Client is
                           entitled to use such Cancellation or Buyout option subject to the conditions specified on the
                           platform. Such conditions can also include the fee charged by the Company.
                           Such a fee is specified on the platform. The Company is obliged to provide all necessary
                           information as to the conditions of Cancellation and Buyout, their cost, etc. The Client
                           acknowledges and agrees
                           that the provision of such information on the platform is sufficient. The Client acknowledges
                           and agrees that the use of Cancellation or Buyout is very risky to the Client as long as the
                           cost of Cancellation and/or Buyout depends on the market situation. The Client acknowledges
                           and agrees that he bears all the risks associated with the use of Cancellation and/or Buyout.

                              Your current version of the platform enables you to choose between the following modes for
                              order submission. You agree
                              that you will be bound by the procedures and conditions specified herein with respect to

                                 There are several steps you have to follow when using the default mode for the
                                 submission of orders. Using the default
                                 mode, you first invoke the instruments menu and choose the assets you want to trade.
                                 Then you select all parameters
                                 depending on the instrument you have chosen and confirm your order submission by
                                 clicking either Buy/Call or Sell/Put
                                 buttons depending on the particular order type selected and your trading intentions.
                                 Using the default mode, a
                                 confirmation window will appear, and you will have to confirm your intentions and the
                                 trade details in order to confirm
                                 the transaction. Your order will not be submitted until you have completed the
                                 aforementioned procedure.
                              </li>

                                 The One-Click Trading mode for order submission (“One-click trading”) is a one-step
                                 process. You will be submitting
                                 orders when you single-click either Buy/Call or Sell/Put buttons.

                           There will be no subsequent confirmation prompt for you to click; hence you should ensure

                           are set based on your trading intentions. You will not be able to withdraw your order once
                           you click the Buy/Call or
                           Sell/Put buttons (with the exemption of a 3-second cancellation period for binary options)
                           and only certain parameters
                           such as stop loss and take profit orders for CFDs can be modified after having opened a
                           trade. Under normal market
                           conditions and system performance, a market order will be promptly filled after submission,
                           and you will have entered
                           into a binding transaction.
