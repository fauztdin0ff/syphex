                     <p>Before you (our client and/or prospective client) apply for a trading account with the Company
                        and
                        begin trading on financial markets, please review carefully the below list of risks in
                        conjunction with
                        the Terms & Conditions.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Risk Warning</h3>
                     <p>The financial products offered by the Company, including Contracts for Difference (‘CFDs’) are
                        complex financial products, most of which have no set maturity date. Therefore, a CFD position
                        matures on the date you choose to close an existing open position. Trading CFDs carries a high
                        level of risk, since the multiplier tool (leverage) can work both to your advantage and
                        disadvantage.
                        As a result, it may not be suitable for all investors because you may lose all your invested
                        capital.
                        You should not risk more capital than you are prepared to lose. Before trading you should
                        understand the risks involved and take into account your level of experience. You should seek
                        independent advice if necessary.</p>

                     <h3>Introduction</h3>
                     <p>This Risk Disclosure is intended to inform you of the general risks that exist in trading
                        activities on
                        our website and of dealing in the Financial Instruments offered by the Company. You must
                        recognize
                        that these risks entail a chance of losing money while trading. This disclosure is informational
                        and
                        must not be considered a list of all possible risks.
                     </p>
                     <p>Trading in the Financial Instruments offered through this website is VERY SPECULATIVE AND
                        HIGHLY RISKY and may involve a risk of loss of all your investments. The products offered by the
                        Company are categorized as high-risk complex Financial Instruments and are not suitable for all
                        members of the general public but only for those investors who:</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved. You should be aware of
                           the risks inherent in trading in these Financial Instruments and be able to bear such risks.
                        </li>
                        <li>are able to assume financially the loss of their entire investment amount, taking into
                           consideration their personal finances, including resources and obligations.
                        </li>
                        <li>possess the appropriate level of experience and/or knowledge of the specific Financial
                           Instruments offered by the Company. It is important for you to ensure that any decision to
                           engage in trading CFDs and other products offered by the Company, is made on an informed
                           basis, and that you understand the nature of the CFDs/products offered and the extent of all
                           the risks associated with CFDs and other products.</li>
                        <li>Please note that CFDs are leveraged financial products and therefore, as such, trading in
                           CFDs using the Company’s ‘multiplier’ (leverage) tool involves high risk of loss as price
                           movements are influenced by the amount of multiplier (leverage) used. For more information,
                           please refer to the Company’s Order Execution Policy.</li>
                     </ol>

                     <h3>1. Risks Associated with Trading in Financial Instruments</h3>
                     <p>The Financial Instruments offered by the Company derive their value from the performance of the
                        underlying assets/markets. It is important therefore that you understand the risks associated
                        with
                        trading in the relevant underlying asset/market because movements in the performance of the
                        underlying asset/ market will affect the profitability of your trade.</p>
                     <p>Information on the previous performance of Financial Instruments does not guarantee the same
                        circumstances of its current and/or future performance. The use of historical data does not lead
                        to a
                        safe forecast.</p>
                     <p>Trading in the Financial Instruments offered by the Company can put your capital at risk. These
                        Financial Instruments are categorized as high risk complex products, and you may lose all or
                        part of
                        the amount invested. Trading in the Financial Instruments offered by the Company is not suitable
                        for
                        all categories of investors. Your investment decisions are subject to various markets, currency,
                        economic, political, business risks etc., and will not necessarily be profitable. You
                        acknowledge, and
                        without any reservation accept, that the value of any investment in a Financial Instrument may
                        vary
                        either upwards or downwards. You acknowledge, and without any reservation accept, the existence
                        of a substantial risk of incurring losses and damages as a result of the buying or selling of
                        any
                        Financial Instrument offered by the Company and acknowledge your intent to take such risk.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Company will not provide you with any investment recommendations or with any advice that is
                        directly or indirectly connected with the trading of Financial Instruments, and you acknowledge
                        that
                        the services provided by us do not include investment advice. This includes guidance in relation
                        to
                        underlying assets, the market or specific trading strategies.</p>
                     <p>You should note that the Company may provide you, from time to time, with useful information
                        about
                        relatable subjects created by third parties, BUT the Company does not approve or endorse this
                        information and/or these tools. Such information may be indicative of trading trends or trading
                        opportunities, and it should be understood that, by taking any actions as a result of this
                        information/tools, you accept and understand that it can cause loss of all your capital. We
                        don’t
                        accept liability for any such losses resulting from actions taken by you based on information
                        and or
                        tools produced by third parties.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Company may also provide, at its discretion, information, news, market commentary or any
                        other information through its website, agents or platform, but when it does so, it is understood
                        that
                        the information is provided solely to enable you to make your own investment decisions and does
                        not amount to investment advice. You accept that you are solely responsible for the trades you
                        make
                        and that any transaction you enter into is done so based on your own judgment.
                     </p>
                     <p><b>Market Risk:</b> Due to the high volatility of the Market, prices of most Financial
                        Instruments traded can
                        vary considerably over the course of a day, which may bring you profit as well as loss. Those
                        Financial Instruments with volatile price movements should be carefully considered as there are
                        higher risks of loss. Prices may fluctuate due to changes in market conditions which are beyond
                        your
                        control and that of the Company, and it may not be possible for trades to be executed at the
                        declared
                        prices resulting in losses. The volatility of the market can be affected by, but is not limited
                        to,
                        changes in the supply & demand, national & international policy, geopolitical instability and
                        economical/political events or announcements.</p>
                     <p><b>Liquidity Risk:</b> This is the financial risk that for a certain period of time an
                        underlying asset cannot
                        be traded quickly enough in the market without impacting the market price. You must acknowledge
                        that some products offered by the Company may suffer from liquidity strains due to adverse
                        market
                        conditions, and as such, the asset may be volatile and have a higher degree of risk. The
                        volatility
                        may be reflected in a larger spread between the ASK and BID prices, resulting in a change in the
                        price of the product.</p>
                     <p><b>OTC/Counterparty Risk:</b> Financial Instruments offered by the Company are Over-the- counter
                        (OTC) or off-exchange traded. This means the trading is done directly between two parties,
                        without
                        any supervision of an exchange. The Company sets the conditions for trading according to its
                        obligations to provide the best execution for our clients.
                     </p>
                     <p>OTC/Counterparty risk is the risk that, as there is no exchange market, the derivative
                        transaction
                        may not be closed out of an Open position. Prices quoted are established by dealers, which
                        consequently make it difficult to ensure fair pricing to assess exposure to risk.</p>
                     <p><b>Foreign Exchange Risk:</b> If a Financial Instrument is traded in a currency other than the
                        currency of
                        your account, changes in exchange rate may affect the value of the transaction negatively,
                        resulting
                        in financial losses.
                     </p>
                     <h3>2. Risks associated with trading in CFDs on cryptocurrencies</h3>
                     <ol>
                        <li>The CFDs on Cryptocurrency Services are not suitable for all investors. The CFDs on
                           Cryptocurrency Services are highly complex and, as such, Clients must always make sure
                           that are fully aware and understand the specific characteristics and risks regarding the said
                           CFDs on Cryptocurrency Services and have extensive knowledge and/or expertise of the
                           CFDs on Cryptocurrency Services and of the underlying assets of the financial instruments
                           offered by the CFDs on Cryptocurrency Services</li>
                        <li>Trading on financial instruments offered by the CFDs on Cryptocurrency Services carries a
                           high risk of losing all your invested capital in your trading account and/or in a specific
                           trade.</li>
                        <li>Trading prices of the financial instruments and underlying assets offered by the CFDs on
                           Cryptocurrency Services carry high volatility and thereby can widely fluctuate or become
                           temporarily or permanently unavailable; therefore, Clients should trade carefully and only
                           with funds that they can afford to lose</li>
                        <li>The nature of Cryptocurrencies may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack, and
                           may mean that technological difficulties experienced by the Company may prevent the
                           access to or use of the CFDs on Cryptocurrency Services.

                           other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Cryptocurrencies are a unique
                           kind of currencies, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take
                           corrective measures to protect the value of Cryptocurrencies in a crisis or issue more
                           currency.</li>

                     <p>Virtual currencies are complex and high-risk products and as such, you could lose your entire

                     </p>
                     <p>Virtual currencies can widely fluctuate and may result in significant loss over a short period
                        of time.
                        You should not trade in virtual currencies in case you do not have the necessary knowledge and
                        expertise in these products.</p>
